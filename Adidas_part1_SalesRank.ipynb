Being a fan of \"old-school\" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic \"shell toe\" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I\\'m sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain\\'t gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y\\'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it\\'s worth considering if you\\'re a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park.',\n",

But I was surprised how goofy these looked on me in person!  First, several reviewers recommended sizing up, but I would disagree.  I usually wear a 9.5 or 10, so I got a 10, and these extend over an inch behind my heels.  The band over the foot is excessively tall, making it pretty loose to walk in.  If you tighten the velcro, the top part of the band then sticks straight out to the side, which just looks silly.  Finally, I'm not sure if it's just the too-large size, but the sandals look much bulkier on me than they do in the picture.  They are fairly heavy and thick in both the sole and the band.  I'm very lazy about returning purchases so I kept these -- but I'd recommend skipping them and looking elsewhere.\",\n",

Returned to the USA and had to buy another pair which didn't last as long as the others which was an older product made of stronger material.Ordered another pair in hopes these would last longer than the last ones. The little knobies that massage the feet do fall out after wearing as I do wear them daily for my feet & legs & lower back impact of hard tile floors. Can't give a 5 star for the product because of the lower quality of material used when I know the same product from over 10 years ago but their delivery was in very good time. Since I have not been able to find a replacement product equal I must order them again. Unfortunately the manufacturer needs to use their prior formula in material to return to quality & longevity to have satisfied customers.\",\n",

I bought them to use around the pool as I did not want my feet sliding out of a regular pair of flip flops and on to extremely hot concrete. They work very well for this, but I would not wear them to go shopping or walking any long distances.UPDATE: I have gotten used to these sandals. I do use them for shopping now. 4 out of 5 stars.',\n",

I'm a size 7 but in this style I could really use a 6.5, except they don't make half sizes.  So my feet would always look a little lost in them, but I'd tighten the strap to keep them on my feet and wear them at home and walking the dogs on fairly tough, hilly high desert terrain.  I liked the feel of the nubs, but inevitably they'd break off in big patches and the strap would start tearing off and I'd have to tape it closed.  And of course, the sole would be worn down and I'd be sliding down slopes.  Which meant it was time to buy another pair for the next year.But it looks like I won't be buying these sandals this year.  I've been pricing them on Amazon and other places online, and I think they're expensive for what you get and how long they last, and there's really not much of a selection.  I suspect there's a lot of snob appeal to these sandals and the company deliberately makes them a little hard to find.  So I'm going to break out of the pack and try a lesser known, more reasonably priced brand of massage sandals this year. I'm giving them 3 stars for sentimental reasons.\",\n",

I was using regular cheapy thong style flip flops, but after wearing them in the shower a few times I realized they weren't going to last very long. I wanted something with a strap across so that it would be easier getting them on when wet and I found these for a great price. I was a little worried about whether or not I would like the nubs and it did take a little while to wear them in. I wore big plushy socks with the sandals around the house for a few days. But now they feel great on my feet- especially when I'm in the shower. I wear between sizes 10 and 11 in womens so to be safe I bought these in an 11.

I love clothes so much that I have to schedule when I will buy them so that I don\\'t spend every penny we have on them accidentally.I was looking for shoes to wear at the gym- to and from the pool, in the shower...I saw these- with their great bumps and and the great white black and white adidas design that all of the cool girls from my high school wore (leftover high school envy)- and I thought- these are the ones. Next year!So I put them in the schedule- and finally bought them the following year. They arrived- more comfortable than I even imagined. Perfect for the gym. Perfect for the gym shower. Absolutely what I was looking for...But two days after I go to the gym with them for the first time, I am in my car asking myself in a panic, \"What is that smell?\"Of course it was my new shoes. I love these shoes. But they smell so bad! For a year I have suffered through the smell- I still love the way they look and feel- but what am I going to do? After a full year of serious cat pea/rotten fruit smell in my car every time I have my gym bag in the car, I think I am going to have to admit defeat. I have tried washing them; I have tried drying them each time after I wear them. I want to apologize every time I\\'m in the gym with them. I want to say, \"Can you believe my shoes smell like this?\" Every time my kids get in the car when I have my gym bag in there, they ask, \"What\\'s that smell? It\\'s so bad.\"At my brother\\'s house, we got into his month-old car and he started sniffing like a maniac. \"What the hell? Is there rotten fruit in the car?\" He ran back to the trunk... And removed- his own pair of adidas sandals.More evidence that it\\'s the shoes that smell bad (for doubters): I only use the gym bag for my swimming things. I wash my bathing suit at the gym (so the chlorine doesn\\'t eat it) and then I run it through the centrifugey thing to dry it. It is 90% dry when I pack it up. That only ever smells like chlorine and bathing suit material. My goggles and swim cap smell like plastic. The only other thing I have in the bag are shampoos. I only wear the shoes from the changing room to the pool, back to the changing room, and then in the shower, then I dry them and pack them up for next time.This is just so, so sad. These shoes smell so bad. I did see a pair with clear plastic bumps. If those specifically have reviews saying that they don\\'t smell bad, I may plan to get those one day.',\n",

After a few months, the strap broke off one of them and I couldn't use them anymore.As for the slides when it wasn't broken, it was pretty comfortable and worked well as shower shoes. I'd probably find a sturdier pair (check the connection of the strap to the base) if I decide to wear them actively outside instead of occasional use (sports, shower shoes, etc).Buy this particular pair if you want a pair of slides for light use.Rating: 3.5 Stars\",\n",

I like slides to begin with, and i had the old version of these before because someone gave them to me and they broke when i was playing football in them. the new version still massages your feet, when you don't have socks on, and doesn't hurt. the old ones were better when i had socks on but these have more grip, and are better feeling. the little bumps are just flexible enough to be borderline squishy, but not too much where you feet slide around. the first thing i noticed about the sandals was that they don't fall off very much. they are good overall and i would suggest buying them if this is what you want.however, I saw one review that said they are not good shower sandals because they take a long time to dry. i don't use them for shower sandals, but i have noticed that when they get wet, they take a long time to dry, so i try not to get them wet. it is summer when you wear sandals, so if you leave them out in the sun, (esp in the south) they will be dry in no time. you should just make an effort to do so.I would only suggest buying this sandal to somebody who wanted to use them for not having to wear their court shoes or cleats etc home from practice and games. they would probably also work at the beach, except that they look cool and might get stolen...i don't really like wearing them everywhere, because they are kind of clunky. also, by other flip flops go better with most of my out fits because they are brown. however, i can't wear them with socks. thus, I would say for my purposes, i am satisfied and would tell anyone to buy this product if they knew why they wanted them.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': 'I searched a long time for a simple width-adjustable slide that came in a size 14 and had a comfortable nubbly sole.  This Adidas slide fit the bill perfectly.  The surface of the sole against your feet is made of a tough clear plastic material with rounded nubs.  These are not the stubby kind that stick up, hurt to walk on, and eventually break off and end up in your vacuum cleaner.  These nubs are short rounded bumps and will not detach or break off from the sole.  They provide just the right amount of stimulus to the soles of my feet, and they actually help keep them from sweating or sticking to the sole when I step out of the shower with wet feet.I have not seen a comparable slide anywhere, so I buy these year after year.  I am not sure how fashionable they are anymore, and since utility, no matter how good it is, takes a back seat to fashion with progressive shoe manufacturers, it is always possible they may be discontinued in the future by Adidas.  I hope not, because I live in these slides and have been buying them for years.  I wear them in my bare feet or with socks on, around the house, and even in my home office during the work day.  I always keep one new spare pair in my closet in case they are ever out of stock when I need a pair.My only complaint is that they are costly for such a simple slide, and this may be related to the Adidas branding.  But to me they are worth it because they are so comfortable.  They are reasonably durable, and I usually get one year out of them while wearing them quite a bit during that time.  When they do fail, the point of failure is usually the attachment of the adjustable strap to the sole.  I keep an eye on this to know when I will soon need a new pair.  I have never had the soles or the nubs come even close to wearing out.',\n",

I saw the Calissage has good reviews, and the nubs are bigger so I was hoping they'd be more durable (recent reviews on the Adissage show they're lot less durable now, nubs falling off fast), so I thought I'd try the Calissage.The problem I have with the Calissage is they're not form-fitting like the Adissage--no arch support at all.  The Adissage is contoured to the bottom of the foot at the arch and under the toes.  Also there is hardly any massaging effect, maybe this is just because I'm used to the much more aggressive massaging effect the the nubs on the Adissage. No, actually these can't offer good massaging effect: it's not form-fitting and so there is too little foot to slide contact.  It can't massage what it doesn't touch.  This is basically just a cheap pair of slide at big brand prices.  Guess I'm just outta luck with Adidas now until they go back to using more durable materials for the Adissage.  I won't be buying another pair for a while.\",\n",

I needed something comfortable to wear in the office where I have to be on my feet and walk around several hours a day and my regular shoes would make my feet sore, so I was hoping that these massaging slides would work better. Well, they do work better in a sense that my feet are not sore anymore, but unfortunately they are now completely cramped. Lack of arch support is a BIG problem, much worse even than regular slippers, because the rubber/plastic sole yields under your weight below your heel which puts a lot of pressure on the bones inside you foot without providing any arch support to offset this pressure. You wear these slides for a few hours and your feet are cramped for a few days. If you are looking for casual comfortable slides for everyday use, these are not a good choice. If you need something for your trips to soccer practice, these are perfect.',\n",

I had cheap shoes from Walmart literally fall apart from the strong force that comes from playing on hard court. These adidas are in entirely different class. The materials are so good that they still show little wear and tear. None of the rubber parts come apart like so many other shoes I had. No cracked leather parts, no torn seams.I don't think you can find a better tennis shoe for that price. I got these for $43 and they are so much better than the last three $34 cheap shoes I bought at Walmart. I plan on buying this shoe again, but so far the ones I have are still holding up just great.I have also used them as running shoes a little. Obviously this is not a running shoe, but they works OK for that as well. I rarely can recommend a product as much as these shoes.

He emailed back saying he wanted this pair of shoes (among other items) and so I didn\\'t get them ordered until December 18th ~ only minutes later (after ordering), his size was not showing any longer, so we must have ordered them right in time! And using the Super Saver Shipping ~ we didn\\'t expect them to be there until AFTER Christmas with amazon.com \"estimating\" they would ship on December 24th at the time of ordering ~ they were on his doorstep on December 22nd! Great going, Amazon! Great shoes! Great shipping! Great gift! Our family has had mixed experiences with adidas in the past, but this particular pair is one of the best.',\n",

I wanted to tell amazon how unhappy I was with my purchase, but they only allow 200 characters to explain the reason for return (and ITEM WAS USED is not one of the catagories to choose from).  That being said, I have decided to list here what I would have said to amazon had I been given the chance:You should have another choice under reason for return: other.  In this case other would be getting merchandise that was clearly used by someone else before being sent to me (the shoes are dirty and show obvious signs of wear).  They are disgusting.  The shoes were meant to be a Christmas gift, but they turned out to be a disappointment.  Rarely do I place feedback about a product or website, but this is one of those few exceptions.  I am so shocked by the poor quality of the product (and service) that I must inform other consumers.  Also, the fact that your customer service telephone number is impossible to find is ridiculous.  When I'm upset with a product or service, I expect to have a number to call so that I can share my concerns and hopefully receive some positive feedback.  Having to write out my experience seems less than acceptable (and not particularly sympathetic).**I know that doesn't really describe the shoes themselves but does it really matter how good the shoes are if they have already been used by someone else?\",\n",

The shoes were in perfect brand-new condition, as were the laces. This is my first pair of Samba's and certainly won't be my last . They are slightly narrow so if you're in a half size, size up.

I picked up a white pair a year ago and liked it so much I immediately bought a second pair in black.  These are without doubt the best casual shoes I've ever had, I'll always be wearing them.  If I found out this line was being discontinued, I would buy a dozen pairs.  They're casual and semi-sleek and very comfortable.  I have narrow feet and they fit very well.  I also walk around a whole lot, and these shoes are hardly worse for the wear.They do look a little distinctive with the three Adidas lines proudly displayed alongside...I prefer unlabeled clothing.

Inside, you can hear them at least 15 yards away. Outside, unless a bus is passing by, you still hear them when you walk. Plus, the QUALITY IS BAD. The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months. The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe, causing severe discomfort. Mainly, THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT. Who's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school? YOU. Who's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym? YOU. Who's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas? YOU. I bought these so I could do martial arts, but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting (thank goodness I'm not trying to be a Ninja!), and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes. OH, and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe, rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable?\",\n",

Tried heavier socks.  Made shoe too narrow and there was still 1.5 inches in front of my big toe even on the larger foot.  One of my feet is larger which is why I order 13.  Other is maybe 12 or 12.5, same medium (D) width.........at least it's not my ears, LOL.IF shoes were shorter, a proper 13, fit was excellent with light socks.  Construction was above average.  However even if I re-ordered 12s?? that tongue looks and feels dumb.  So today I am sending them back.Incidentally I also received a pair of Samoas in 13 and they fit perfect even though they are also adidas.  So the oversize is just in the Samba?

I originally tried the  Samba 'Original' shoe but found that they were more narrow than I had liked and they squeaked alot when I walked. I took those back and tried the Samba 'Classic' and loved how they fit. They are better for a wider foot because they 'give' more than the 'Original' in my opinion. The tongue is really long but you can fold it down if you want, not a big deal for me but may be for others. Overall, nice shoe and worth the cash.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"What can I say? Adidas knows how to construct a fine piece of footwear. Look at that style: nothing gaudy or unnecessary. Its beauty is derived from its superior function. That leather wrapped around your toes at the contact area? Useful and stylish. The grip pattern on the bottom? Superb. A tongue stronger than a sailor's? Unmatched.This has to be my fourth pair by now and I just can't go back to any other kind of shoe. What always bums me out is when I have a nice-looking pair of shoes and they have some catastrophic failure of structural integrity. The wall tears. The rubber separates from the boot. This is just a non-issue for the Sambas. In every pair. EVERY. PAIR. I only buy a new pair because the grip on the bottom has worn down. The rest of the shoe, while a little scratched up and worn in, is still carrying on like its just getting warmed up. And this is after about a year. I got my last pair 10 months ago and the only noticeable wear is on two spots: One by the top-most eyelet on each shoe (because I sit cross-legged on concrete sometimes) and the sole of the heel. I think that's just because I walk heel-to-toe (I don't understand creeps who walk otherwise, but apparently that's a thing) and that's getting kind of thin. The first wear spot is purely cosmetic and barely noticeable, but the wear on the heel may be a problem in a few more months. I still have my last pair as throw-away shoes for mowing the lawn. The &#34;grip&#34; on the bottom is completely non-existent at this point, but come on, I've had them for like 3 or 4 years now. Can any other shoe match that? Yeah right.TL;DRIf you're tired of being a nostyle scrub, buy these. The bottom rubber will be the first thing to go after a year (maybe two!) of lots of walking / playing. I talk a lot about the grip wearing out, but that's because THAT'S ALL that ever really wears out! And it's only after about 1-1.5 years that you'll notice any wear, and it will be cosmetic.\",\n",

I decided though for under $50 I'd get a new pair and they seem to be of the same high quality as my old ones... with one flaw. Without knowing it, they changed the arch support... or should I say added it? The old ones don't really have any at all, and to me, that was actually pretty comfortable. These new ones feel like someone shoved a couple of baseballs in my shoes... it's not a deal breaker, but I wish they had offered the new arch support as an option, as given the choice I wouldn't have wanted it. I'm hopeful that with some wear it'll compress the new arch support as to not be so noticeable, but only time will tell on that one.

When I first buy them, they are tight and the arch is too high for my foot. The leather, however, stretches and the arch changes to fit your foot. After about a week, these shoes feel like a custom fit. I play soccer with friends and they are amazing for that too. Of course, I wouldn't recommend these for a world cup  futsal game, but they work for me. Only complaint is that the tongue is occasionally vexing but that can be fixed easily (tucked in, cut, folded over).Update 12/3/13: I've worn out this pair and I bought another in the hemp variety because they were to only ones that came in a cardinal color.

(25 years) You see them everywhere, they look great on everyone, yet it never crossed my mind to get a pair for myself (I\\'m talking about the black with white stripes version).  But now that I have, I say again, how stupid of me to wait for so long.I appreciate the reviewer who pointed out the difference between \"classic\" and \"original\" (I never noticed there were choices).  I went for the classic because I like the super long tongue, which looks cool worn either hidden or sitting on top of jeans.  I\\'m also glad I bought these in a store and not online, because on my first try with the 10.5\\'s, they felt like my heel slipped out too easily.  I thought the 10\\'s were perfect, but then started to pinch slightly the longer I walked around the store.  When I went back to the 10.5\\'s, they suddenly fit like a glove.I wore them to the movie theater this weekend, and smiled the whole time I sat there because these shoes feel like they\\'re hugging my feet.  Like \"sole\" mates finally united.  They have just the tiniest little arch support, not too much, just enough, and it\\'s appreciated.They just feel high quality.  I should never buy anything but Adidas again; I have a pair of Adidas hiking shoes that I\\'ve been wearing for over a decade.  They\\'ve seen better times, but are still super comfortable and still holding together (mostly).  When you find something that works, don\\'t fix it.  That\\'s why I feel like these could be my new \"forever\" shoe (if/when this pair wears out).

The arch support is obviously not as good as other shoes that focus on arch support but the arch support in these is better than pretty much any Adidas or Nike flat-soled shoe out there. If you actually play soccer like me, you'll love the pure feeling of the ball on your foot. The grip is ridiculously good, outdoors and indoors. If you feel that the grip sucks indoors, you need to wipe and clean the outsole. The first time you wear it, you'll notice how comfortable it is and it only gets better than that. It feels like it's already broken in but trust me.. when it really breaks in you won't be thinking about any other shoe. The first pair I bought was a special edition white with blue stripes and I can't find them anymore. This time I bought the black pair with white stripes. Get them and you'll be happy.\",\n",

The sole provides a lot of grip (I don't play soccer in them but the floors at my work are often wet and I don't slip and fall). You can get the classic kind or the originals kind (only difference I can tell is the length of the tongue, I have no preference). The laces that came with mine are the perfect length, the shoes fit like a glove. Many say they run small, but I do believe they have wide feet, because the Sambas have a sort of average or almost narrow design. Either way they fit me perfect when I ordered my normal size. These shoes last a long time, I have owned a few pairs now. I wear them until they die which is everyday for about a year. They have many different colors to choose from, but they all look good. They can be casual shoes or dressed up just a tad (they're athletic shoes, not dress shoes) but they look good with jeans or shorts. Overall great shoes, Amazon has a great price for them. I highly recommend them!\",\n",

Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a \"buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly\" promotion and Amazon prime, so my \"refund\" would be less than nothing.That\\'s right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women\\'s section of the site might be men\\'s shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair.',\n",

This shoe offers good arch support for those long days on my feet at work.My current pair has lasted me a decade (through High School and College). I have finally worn a hole in the heel side of the sole which lets water in if I step in a puddle, and the suede in some parts is worn smooth, but with a coat of carefully applied shoe polish, they don't look more than two or three years old.This is definitely a timeless shoe.

The shoes are casually athletic, like white guys who say, \"Yeah, I play soccer\" but in fact have never played soccer for a recreational team and have little-to-none-at-all knowledge about the sport, but the idea sounds good.  What\\'s better than running around on green grass, sometimes getting to kick a ball, in short shorts and a jersey, giving yourself and others the impression that you\\'re athletic?  You\\'re fooling everyone, don\\'t worry.  And after you wipe your forehead and throw your short bangs back, covered in sweat, after you trot over to the sideline, breathing hard, grab a towel, wipe yourself off, sit down in the grass and not the bleachers (on purpose, of course; athletes don\\'t sit in seating apparatuses), take off those hopefully-filthy cleats and slip on these cool-as-hell vintage shoes.  I promise they will reinforce your image as an athlete.  Did I mention they feel like a foot-rub given by the most beautiful girl in the world?  Please, wear these shoes with a sense of honor: be yourself, and for God\\'s sakes, don\\'t pop your collar.',\n",

Best shoe I have ever owned. This new one, which is supposedly manufactured in Vietnam, looks just as great! However, it just doesn't fit correctly on the wide part of the foot between the arch and your toes. It is way too narrow and hurts a lot.Other reviews complained about the narrowness, but I figured they didn't give the shoes a chance. I thought that maybe, like cleats, I just needed to &#34;break them in.&#34; The first day it hurt a lot, but I put up with it. The second day it hurt a little bit less, so I thought maybe it was getting better. The third day it hurt more than the first two days...so I said forget it...I have to return them. Also, loosening them doesn't help either.It was a tough decision because they used to be amazing shoes: unmatched traction, perfect style. However, it's not worth messing up your feet. They really need to fix the fit-design and I'll give them another try in a few years.\",\n",

As a soccer player my first pair was purchased to use for indoor soccer but they made their way into my closet as an everyday shoe. They are comfortable enough play a full game on turf or to wear casually for hours at a time. The black shoe with three white stripes on the side is a classic adidas design that looks good with anything. The reason I have had to purchase so many pairs has nothing to do with the quality of the shoe but because these are the shoe I will put on 8/10 times, I usually end up with a new pair about once every year and nothing looks and feels better than having on a fresh pair of sambas.',\n",

As an adult, I feel this shoe fills an excellent sport-casual role. It's a performance shoe when you need it to be, and it's got classic styling. I wear the tongue folded. I had to oil the leather and the felt and leave them rubber-banded for the first few weeks of wear to get it to fold over. My only reservation is that the arch support could be placed a little farther back in the shoe, to really 'cup' the heel. But overall I am super impressed by the rest of the support. The footbed hits all three arches in the foot, not just the main one, and when oiled regularly the leather really becomes supple and glove-like on the foot.\",\n",

These shoes are really well made, the leather is very high quality plus they are cool, classic and functional. If you are getting these for soccer I would say get the long tongue (more control over the ball), if you just want these for the look the short tongue is fine. I actually have the Samba K's, kangaroo leather version at the moment and I was really upset to see that they have discontinued them. I have read that the K's are incredibly durable and the leather just molds to your foot in a unique way. I think they look as good now as they did 5 years ago. These shoes do run narrow, so I usually get a half size larger and that works for me since I have wider feet. Overall you cannot go wrong with these. They are worth any price IMO.\",\n",

I don\\'t think I am going back to any other sneaker -- this is definitely the most comfortable shoe I have ever personally worn, and that\\'s good enough for me.I will note that the shoe laces are on the short side, and I have considered getting longer ones, but I have made due with the ones that it came with so far.

Recently though, I essentially tore open the bottom of my K-Swiss Ariakes and so to do parkour I switched to these shoes. Surprisingly, they were also great for parkour. It is not something many would assume, the lack of cushioning, hard sole etc. etc. But contrary to those facts, the hard sole provided enough grip to be functional, not as much as the Ariakes, but acceptable amounts. The thin sole also actually helped my form, having a thinner sole allows for better feel and results in a more refined technique. The cushioning problem also actually helps you, it points out the flaws in your running and landing and after a while you don't feel the shock of the hits. Also, these are built tough. The leather shows signs of wear and tear without yielding, the sole is hard and will take a lot of effort to wear down, I only recently broke these after almost 2 and a half years of wear, and that's when I was doing hard wall runs. And an added bonus, the leather keeps moisture out so your feet don't get all wet when running after it rains. The pros and cons of these shoes have been iterated many times already in these reviews, so looking at them from a different perspective, as a traceur, these shoes perform wonderfully. They are not real parkour shoes (if those actually can be a category) but they are amazing trainers and will not dissapoint.\",\n",

In my shallowness, I bought them on looks alone for around-the-house/ casual-Friday's.They are a bit narrow, which is great for me. But they do lack a bit in arch/ball of the foot support. You'd think that if they're making these shoes for narrow-footed people, they would have better arch support because most people with narrow feet tend to have higher arches, right? If you have wide feet, you might want to avoid these.As for the extra-long tongue, I have to say that I kind of like it. It makes the shoes unique. But I think if you wore low-socks, the tongue might chafe you and look funny. Also, folding the tongue down looks kind of dumb as you can see part of the sizing tag.I found the sizing (10.5) to be pretty much right on, maybe a smidge bigger than my other Adidas. Overall though, for the price (I found mine on sale for $30!), I thought they were are a great deal! I really like these Samba Classics. They look fantastic and fit good for a casual shoe. I just wish they had a bit more support (like the Samba Millenium's do), then they'd be perfect.\",\n",

However, that's not my main complaint.  While these shoes are stylish and comfortable to walk around in, they're horrible soccer shoes.  I've played on two separate indoor fields and anytime I make a hard cut I slip.  The other problem is that after a game my feet are sore due to the lack of arch support.

I've played two pickup games that aren't too serious and I could barely walk after each one.  They absorb no impact when you run and even though I tied them as tight as I could, blisters will still forming.The one positive thing I'll say about them is they get much more traction then my regular sneakers on an indoor basketball floor so I can change direction better, which is part of the reason I get blisters because I cut/change direction very fast.  (I get them with regular shoes, but I was hoping these would stop that)I suppose if you're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers.  Also the extra long shoe tongue is annoying and looks bad folded down.  (on the white sneakers at least)I went back to my tennis shoes, I'm getting rid of these.\",\n",

My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look.\",\n",

Despite the lack of cushioning in the Classics, I can wear them for hours on hard courts and turf without any problem. I also own Samba Vulcs, which are equally comfortable to me.I was intrigued by these Samba Milleniums, which I have never seen in a retail store. When I received them, I was impressed by how good they look. The lines are not as clean as the Samba Classics, but so much better than most modern trainers which look like spaceships on your feet. When I put them on, I was also impressed how comfortable they felt. The toe box is larger than the Classics. I usually have the wear the Classics for a week for the toe box to stretch out enough to be comfortable, but I didn't have that issue with the Milleniums. There is also just the right amount of padding in the heel - enough to add comfort, but not so much that you can't feel the ball.The reason I'm deducting 1 star from perfect is that right now, the shoe rubs against my left lateral malleolus, which doesn't happen with the Classics. I'm hoping that with some break-in, this problem will go away.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"I'm just about to turn forty and have played soccer since I was 8.  These are the best indoor shoes I've ever owned.I'm writing a review because I read some of the other reviews that stated they were too small and or took a long time to break in.  I'm a firm believer that soccer shoes should fit like a second skin.  I've only had one pair of soccer shoes ever (they were outdoor) that broke in quickly--they were very soft leather.  The drawback to soft leather shoes is that they are typically less durable, though that pair actually lasted me a few seasons.Shoes with stiffer leather take longer to break in, plain and simple.  Stiff leather shoes are painful to break in if you want them to stretch to your fit.  I usually endure a few hours of pain wearing new soccer shoes around my house (not all at once of course) before wearing them during play.I'm now buying my second pair of Samba Millenium's.  I bought the first pair at a shoe store after having tried them on there.  I recall the first pair taking a couple of hours of wear around the house and still being uncomfortable during play.  Then after a few sessions of play they were comfortable.  My first pair lasted me 4 or 5 winters of play, 1 to 2 x per week. I'm looking forward to another 4 or 5 winters with my next pair.Best indoor shoes I've ever had.  Durability second to none.  Comfort, after a lengthy breaking in period, second to none.So if you can hack breaking them in, these are great shoes.  If you want shoes that break in quickly, head to the soccer shop and try on some pairs with softer leather.\",\n",

When you combine the build of the shoe with a very reasonable price tag it is not surprising that Sambas are still as popular as they ever were.If you are used to a running shoe the wear might feel a little different as I feel like the Sambas give you a 'flatter' wear in the sole.

I love the samba shoes and have been through several different types and styles over many years.  This style of Sambas are not my favorite (favorites being the Top Salas from around 2000), but they are still very nice and *comfortable.*Lets talk about comfort though.  I have had this issue only with one other style of Sambas (the Classic) and that is regarding the time it takes to break these in so I can actually bare walking.  Even though these shoes fit great now and are probably my most comfortable pair and shoe of choice most days, it took about a month of going through some painful heels and a few blisters to get to this point.I know there are ways to \"work\" your shoes out and break them in, but no matter what I did they were still giving me issues for a long time. I have only bought a few pairs of shoes that needed special treatment to break them in, but these were by far some of the most difficult to work out.Overall, I love these shoes and if you can get through the painful breaking-in period the shoes come out fitting your feet just wonderfully and are great, comfortable shoes for everyday casual wear.',\n",

I am a 10 and purchased a 10.5, which fit nice. Also, when I first put on my Sambas Millenium, I got bad blisters on the back of both my heels. Nevertheless, after reading some reviews here suggesting that you need to break them in to prevent this from occurring in the future (which for me was only after wearing them more than 3 times for me), this did not occur again and now are very, very comfortable. So don't let the initial break-in period cause you to return them right away. Like all good shoes, they need time to fit to your foot.Anyway, I highly recommend these shoes.\",\n",

I'm sure this will go away as the shoes get broken in.  But for now it is starting to give me blisters...Now that they are broken in...  I'm bumping this up to a 5...\",\n",

Although I love soccer and need good shoes to play sala, I actually got these shoes because they had had a pair before and they were so form fitting and true to size that I just couldn't go to another shoe.I ended up getting the black with white stripes so that i could use them as shoes for everyday use and not just for playing soccer.  this was a good decision because i have seen friends with the white and they now look dirty and almost old because of mud or scuff marks.  I do like the white better if you are using them solely for playing soccer, but i am like the black better overall.Anyone who has ever used indoor soccer shoes will know that they are all very comfortable, but some are better than others.  i have had a few pairs from other brand names and I have to admit the sambas that I have now are by far the most comfortable. The shoes might seem a bit tight at first but after a few weeks of use they form to your feet and stretch a bit.  The size runs pretty true so you don't have to worry about getting the wrong size and have to return them.The shoes are very durable and I wear them everywhere, they go well with short, jeans, long socks, short socks and almost anything else. The construction is great and they are very reliable.I don't know if I have any complaints about these shoes and I have loved them since I have bought them.  Although if you live in a place where it snows or gets icy, they are not the best for grip in the snow so thats probably the only thing negative to these shoes.I highly recommend these shoes to anyone.\",\n",

This reasonably priced classic design looks good on the street, but plays well on court surfaces where mobiliity, directional change, and rapid starts and stops are at a premium. My son regularly beats me playing racquetball and I can only assume it must be these shoes....He wore his last pair out over about four years of constant use and had to have a new pair. Beware that buying this shoe may make you an adidas fan for a long time.By the way, I have very wide feet and I can't wear this shoe, even though I'd like to. My experience is that adidas run narrow, so if your feet are narrow or standard, you should be fine, but I think you'll be looking elsewhere if your feet are wide, so don't be sucked in by your studly friends or your awesome sons...\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"I bought these to repair a pair of another brand that had worn out and broken in half. I generally wear these as slippers in the house (I don't like to run around barefoot) - usually with socks. I liked that these were open toed, as opposed to the many types that go between your toes. The velcro makes adjusting them to your foot easy, and I've never reset it sinceA couple of comments -When I first got them, they were somewhat uncomfortable while the nubs were still stiff. I wasn't sure I would be able to continue using them. This got better after a few weeks. I was using them on my walking treadmill one day (with socks), and they actually started to irritate my feet. I generally don't wear these for long distances, but occasionally I will step up to my desk for something short, and 45 minutes later, I'm still there. I'm sure you know what I mean. Recently, I did the same thing, and didn't have any problems.Second, the nubs do break off - not all at once, mind you, but I have several broken on each foot. This doesn't interfere with their comfort or usability in any way.Third - these are fully plastic (or some polyvinyl water resistant product) so they can be rinsed off or can get wet in the shower. The biggest problem I've had with them is my cat got upset with me one day and threw up on one. I didn't realize it until I'd stepped in it, and squeezed it down between the nubs. Let me tell you, it took a while to get it rinsed out -- even with the kitchen scrub brush.I would certainly buy these again - they've proven durable enough to stand up to regular use, and they can get wet (ie: if I take a step outside to get the mail or take out the recycling) without any damage. They can probably be used as shower shoes at the gym, though I haven't used them for this purpose.\",\n",

Here's the strange part... you'd think the nubs on the sandal would raise the foot to get more air circulation but I'm not so sure about that. He's only been wearing them for a few weeks but the foot odor trapped in the sandals is intolerable. He's had lower quality slides without the nubs that didn't smell. Maybe the material and structure of these slides hold moisture better. Okay, I wrote all of that a couple of months ago and now I'm adding this: The nubs are all falling off the shoes! It's VERY annoying because I'm finding them all over the house and unfortunately, so is my 10 month old son who spends much of his time crawling on the floor. I expected much better from Adidas and these sandals.\",\n",
