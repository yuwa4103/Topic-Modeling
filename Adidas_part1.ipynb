The sales person at Foot Locker did not recommend them for walking, but I do. They're comfortable, feminine, and very nicely designed. The shoe is made of breathable leather (a must for this Texas heat!), and fits my foot very nicely. In addition, the padded insole is much more comfortable than a regular tennis shoe. And don't let the thin soles fool you - this shoe is durable!As an Adidas &quot;fan&quot;, I'd recommend this shoe simply because Adidas makes high quality, long-lasting shoes. As someone who needs comfortable shoes, I recommend this pair not only because of the quality, but also because of the comfort they offer. The fact that they're also quite cute (at least, I think so) is an added bonus. Overall, this is a great pair of shoes, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a sturdy and comfortable, yet stylish, pair of shoes for an active lifetsyle.\",\n",

I bought them thinking they were the latter, and I was surprised when I opened the box and saw them in the harsh light of reality.  Having said that, they are indeed fine and rare, and would probably make a handsome addition to your wardrobe.  They are part of Adidas' &quot;stitch down&quot; collection of vintage sneakers re-conceptualized in high end materials, and I don't think you can even find them anywhere else.  These particular shoes are made of corduroy, rather than the traditional samoa suede, and they have nice crepe soles.  If you have wide feet, Adidas can be somewhat tricky to size, so make sure you know your correct Adidas size (go down to your local shoe store and try on a pair of regular samoas for size) before you order.\",\n",

Being a fan of \"old-school\" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic \"shell toe\" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I\\'m sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain\\'t gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y\\'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it\\'s worth considering if you\\'re a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park.',\n",

But I was surprised how goofy these looked on me in person!  First, several reviewers recommended sizing up, but I would disagree.  I usually wear a 9.5 or 10, so I got a 10, and these extend over an inch behind my heels.  The band over the foot is excessively tall, making it pretty loose to walk in.  If you tighten the velcro, the top part of the band then sticks straight out to the side, which just looks silly.  Finally, I'm not sure if it's just the too-large size, but the sandals look much bulkier on me than they do in the picture.  They are fairly heavy and thick in both the sole and the band.  I'm very lazy about returning purchases so I kept these -- but I'd recommend skipping them and looking elsewhere.\",\n",

The little knobies that massage the feet do fall out after wearing as I do wear them daily for my feet & legs & lower back impact of hard tile floors. Can't give a 5 star for the product because of the lower quality of material used when I know the same product from over 10 years ago but their delivery was in very good time. Since I have not been able to find a replacement product equal I must order them again.

I'm a size 7 but in this style I could really use a 6.5, except they don't make half sizes.  So my feet would always look a little lost in them, but I'd tighten the strap to keep them on my feet and wear them at home and walking the dogs on fairly tough, hilly high desert terrain.  I liked the feel of the nubs, but inevitably they'd break off in big patches and the strap would start tearing off and I'd have to tape it closed.  And of course, the sole would be worn down and I'd be sliding down slopes.  Which meant it was time to buy another pair for the next year.But it looks like I won't be buying these sandals this year.  I've been pricing them on Amazon and other places online, and I think they're expensive for what you get and how long they last, and there's really not much of a selection.  I suspect there's a lot of snob appeal to these sandals and the company deliberately makes them a little hard to find.  So I'm going to break out of the pack and try a lesser known, more reasonably priced brand of massage sandals this year. I'm giving them 3 stars for sentimental reasons.\",\n",

I wanted something with a strap across so that it would be easier getting them on when wet and I found these for a great price. I was a little worried about whether or not I would like the nubs and it did take a little while to wear them in. I wore big plushy socks with the sandals around the house for a few days. But now they feel great on my feet- especially when I'm in the shower. I wear between sizes 10 and 11 in womens so to be safe I bought these in an 11.

Since they come only in whole sizes, I was worried they'd be too short, but they are just right; also, I have a wide foot, and the velcro fold over uppers are adjustable, which was a nice surprise.The soles are very pokey, but they are perfect for out-of-the pool, as your feet stay dry. Also, I think the pokey things remind my feet where they are, and give me better balance, which is tricky after swimming. Water in ears and all that. So, since new science research has shown that sole stimulation can help elderly people with their balance issues, I might also order some for my mother-in-law. 'Seems that our feet are so far away from the nerve center, our feet just don't get the signals they need. TMI, I guess, but interesting, I think. Just watch, a whole new eldershoe will emerge with batteries and pokey things that vibrate.As far as the seller, she did reply to an inquiry I sent about delivery time, as it took more than 10 days to receive them.\",\n",

Getting used to the feeling of the massaging pegs took me no more than 5 minutes, but walkig on them was never a problem, funny sensation at first, like somebody tickling your soles. I read the reviews about using socks first, but I had no need of that. Your soles stay kind of sensitive for some days, even when using other shoes, but nothing near to pain, and you soon get over it. I must point out that the upper strap is fabulous! Very soft on your feet, I have a slighty prominent side bone in one of my toes and hard textures really make my life miserable.

I love clothes so much that I have to schedule when I will buy them so that I don\\'t spend every penny we have on them accidentally.I was looking for shoes to wear at the gym- to and from the pool, in the shower...I saw these- with their great bumps and and the great white black and white adidas design that all of the cool girls from my high school wore (leftover high school envy)- and I thought- these are the ones. Next year!So I put them in the schedule- and finally bought them the following year. They arrived- more comfortable than I even imagined. Perfect for the gym. Perfect for the gym shower. Absolutely what I was looking for...But two days after I go to the gym with them for the first time, I am in my car asking myself in a panic, \"What is that smell?\"Of course it was my new shoes. I love these shoes. But they smell so bad! For a year I have suffered through the smell- I still love the way they look and feel- but what am I going to do? After a full year of serious cat pea/rotten fruit smell in my car every time I have my gym bag in the car, I think I am going to have to admit defeat. I have tried washing them; I have tried drying them each time after I wear them. I want to apologize every time I\\'m in the gym with them. I want to say, \"Can you believe my shoes smell like this?\" Every time my kids get in the car when I have my gym bag in there, they ask, \"What\\'s that smell? It\\'s so bad.\"At my brother\\'s house, we got into his month-old car and he started sniffing like a maniac. \"What the hell? Is there rotten fruit in the car?\" He ran back to the trunk... And removed- his own pair of adidas sandals.More evidence that it\\'s the shoes that smell bad (for doubters): I only use the gym bag for my swimming things. I wash my bathing suit at the gym (so the chlorine doesn\\'t eat it) and then I run it through the centrifugey thing to dry it. It is 90% dry when I pack it up. That only ever smells like chlorine and bathing suit material. My goggles and swim cap smell like plastic. The only other thing I have in the bag are shampoos. I only wear the shoes from the changing room to the pool, back to the changing room, and then in the shower, then I dry them and pack them up for next time.This is just so, so sad. These shoes smell so bad. I did see a pair with clear plastic bumps. If those specifically have reviews saying that they don\\'t smell bad, I may plan to get those one day.',\n",

The quality is nice: solid rubber-gel and size adjustment straps on Velcro pads. These slides will last you a long time if you wash them under warm water once in every 4-to-6 months.\",\n",

I like slides to begin with, and i had the old version of these before because someone gave them to me and they broke when i was playing football in them. the new version still massages your feet, when you don't have socks on, and doesn't hurt. the old ones were better when i had socks on but these have more grip, and are better feeling. the little bumps are just flexible enough to be borderline squishy, but not too much where you feet slide around. the first thing i noticed about the sandals was that they don't fall off very much. they are good overall and i would suggest buying them if this is what you want.however, I saw one review that said they are not good shower sandals because they take a long time to dry. i don't use them for shower sandals, but i have noticed that when they get wet, they take a long time to dry, so i try not to get them wet. it is summer when you wear sandals, so if you leave them out in the sun, (esp in the south) they will be dry in no time. you should just make an effort to do so.I would only suggest buying this sandal to somebody who wanted to use them for not having to wear their court shoes or cleats etc home from practice and games. they would probably also work at the beach, except that they look cool and might get stolen...i don't really like wearing them everywhere, because they are kind of clunky. also, by other flip flops go better with most of my out fits because they are brown. however, i can't wear them with socks. thus, I would say for my purposes, i am satisfied and would tell anyone to buy this product if they knew why they wanted them.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': 'I searched a long time for a simple width-adjustable slide that came in a size 14 and had a comfortable nubbly sole.  This Adidas slide fit the bill perfectly.  The surface of the sole against your feet is made of a tough clear plastic material with rounded nubs.  These are not the stubby kind that stick up, hurt to walk on, and eventually break off and end up in your vacuum cleaner.  These nubs are short rounded bumps and will not detach or break off from the sole.  They provide just the right amount of stimulus to the soles of my feet, and they actually help keep them from sweating or sticking to the sole when I step out of the shower with wet feet.I have not seen a comparable slide anywhere, so I buy these year after year.  I am not sure how fashionable they are anymore, and since utility, no matter how good it is, takes a back seat to fashion with progressive shoe manufacturers, it is always possible they may be discontinued in the future by Adidas.  I hope not, because I live in these slides and have been buying them for years.  I wear them in my bare feet or with socks on, around the house, and even in my home office during the work day.  I always keep one new spare pair in my closet in case they are ever out of stock when I need a pair.My only complaint is that they are costly for such a simple slide, and this may be related to the Adidas branding.  But to me they are worth it because they are so comfortable.  They are reasonably durable, and I usually get one year out of them while wearing them quite a bit during that time.  When they do fail, the point of failure is usually the attachment of the adjustable strap to the sole.  I keep an eye on this to know when I will soon need a new pair.  I have never had the soles or the nubs come even close to wearing out.',\n",

I saw the Calissage has good reviews, and the nubs are bigger so I was hoping they'd be more durable (recent reviews on the Adissage show they're lot less durable now, nubs falling off fast), so I thought I'd try the Calissage.The problem I have with the Calissage is they're not form-fitting like the Adissage--no arch support at all.  The Adissage is contoured to the bottom of the foot at the arch and under the toes.  Also there is hardly any massaging effect, maybe this is just because I'm used to the much more aggressive massaging effect the the nubs on the Adissage. No, actually these can't offer good massaging effect: it's not form-fitting and so there is too little foot to slide contact.  It can't massage what it doesn't touch.  This is basically just a cheap pair of slide at big brand prices.  Guess I'm just outta luck with Adidas now until they go back to using more durable materials for the Adissage.  I won't be buying another pair for a while.\",\n",

I needed something comfortable to wear in the office where I have to be on my feet and walk around several hours a day and my regular shoes would make my feet sore, so I was hoping that these massaging slides would work better. Well, they do work better in a sense that my feet are not sore anymore, but unfortunately they are now completely cramped. Lack of arch support is a BIG problem, much worse even than regular slippers, because the rubber/plastic sole yields under your weight below your heel which puts a lot of pressure on the bones inside you foot without providing any arch support to offset this pressure.

You have to pay attention to which kind, the addissage is the one that looks like straight pins and feels like walking on rocks (to me anyway). The Calissage is just little nubs. Guess it all depends on how tough your feet are. I have another pair that is just foam, when they get wet, actual foam does come out the sides. It looks like I've poured liquid soap on my shoes and it's making it bubble.Finally had to replace after 8 years cuz the strap came unglued. I'm sure I can gorilla glue or something, but there's really no traction on them anymore.\",\n",

I had cheap shoes from Walmart literally fall apart from the strong force that comes from playing on hard court. These adidas are in entirely different class. The materials are so good that they still show little wear and tear. None of the rubber parts come apart like so many other shoes I had. No cracked leather parts, no torn seams.I don't think you can find a better tennis shoe for that price. I got these for $43 and they are so much better than the last three $34 cheap shoes I bought at Walmart. I plan on buying this shoe again, but so far the ones I have are still holding up just great.I have also used them as running shoes a little. Obviously this is not a running shoe, but they works OK for that as well. I rarely can recommend a product as much as these shoes. You will find more expensive ones, but I doubt you'll find better quality.\",\n",

That being said, I have decided to list here what I would have said to amazon had I been given the chance:You should have another choice under reason for return: other.  In this case other would be getting merchandise that was clearly used by someone else before being sent to me (the shoes are dirty and show obvious signs of wear).  They are disgusting.  The shoes were meant to be a Christmas gift, but they turned out to be a disappointment.  Rarely do I place feedback about a product or website, but this is one of those few exceptions.  I am so shocked by the poor quality of the product (and service) that I must inform other consumers.  Also, the fact that your customer service telephone number is impossible to find is ridiculous.  When I'm upset with a product or service, I expect to have a number to call so that I can share my concerns and hopefully receive some positive feedback.  Having to write out my experience seems less than acceptable (and not particularly sympathetic).**I know that doesn't really describe the shoes themselves but does it really matter how good the shoes are if they have already been used by someone else?\",\n",

The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months. The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe, causing severe discomfort. Mainly, THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT. Who's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school? YOU. Who's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym? YOU. Who's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas? YOU. I bought these so I could do martial arts, but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting (thank goodness I'm not trying to be a Ninja!), and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes. OH, and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe, rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable?\",\n",

Tried heavier socks.  Made shoe too narrow and there was still 1.5 inches in front of my big toe even on the larger foot.  One of my feet is larger which is why I order 13.  Other is maybe 12 or 12.5, same medium (D) width.........at least it's not my ears, LOL.IF shoes were shorter, a proper 13, fit was excellent with light socks.  Construction was above average.  However even if I re-ordered 12s?? that tongue looks and feels dumb.

Its beauty is derived from its superior function. That leather wrapped around your toes at the contact area? Useful and stylish. The grip pattern on the bottom? Superb. A tongue stronger than a sailor's? Unmatched.This has to be my fourth pair by now and I just can't go back to any other kind of shoe. What always bums me out is when I have a nice-looking pair of shoes and they have some catastrophic failure of structural integrity. The wall tears. The rubber separates from the boot. This is just a non-issue for the Sambas. In every pair. EVERY. PAIR. I only buy a new pair because the grip on the bottom has worn down. The rest of the shoe, while a little scratched up and worn in, is still carrying on like its just getting warmed up. And this is after about a year. I got my last pair 10 months ago and the only noticeable wear is on two spots: One by the top-most eyelet on each shoe (because I sit cross-legged on concrete sometimes) and the sole of the heel. I think that's just because I walk heel-to-toe (I don't understand creeps who walk otherwise, but apparently that's a thing) and that's getting kind of thin. The first wear spot is purely cosmetic and barely noticeable, but the wear on the heel may be a problem in a few more months. I still have my last pair as throw-away shoes for mowing the lawn. The &#34;grip&#34; on the bottom is completely non-existent at this point, but come on, I've had them for like 3 or 4 years now. Can any other shoe match that? Yeah right.TL;DRIf you're tired of being a nostyle scrub, buy these. The bottom rubber will be the first thing to go after a year (maybe two!) of lots of walking / playing. I talk a lot about the grip wearing out, but that's because THAT'S ALL that ever really wears out! And it's only after about 1-1.5 years that you'll notice any wear, and it will be cosmetic.\",\n",

These new ones feel like someone shoved a couple of baseballs in my shoes... it's not a deal breaker, but I wish they had offered the new arch support as an option, as given the choice I wouldn't have wanted it. I'm hopeful that with some wear it'll compress the new arch support as to not be so noticeable, but only time will tell on that one. Even so, I'm only removing 1 star because they're still the best looking sneakers in the world, and the only ones I'll ever be seen in public with.\",\n",

They do lack the modern sole and cushion technology of today's shoe but that is probably not why you are buying this shoe. They look great with jeans and go with almost all casual wear. They look great for about a year of constant wear which is really saying something. This is my third pair. I keep coming back. I will probably be wearing  them 20 years from now.P.S.

(25 years) You see them everywhere, they look great on everyone, yet it never crossed my mind to get a pair for myself (I\\'m talking about the black with white stripes version).  But now that I have, I say again, how stupid of me to wait for so long.I appreciate the reviewer who pointed out the difference between \"classic\" and \"original\" (I never noticed there were choices).  I went for the classic because I like the super long tongue, which looks cool worn either hidden or sitting on top of jeans.  I\\'m also glad I bought these in a store and not online, because on my first try with the 10.5\\'s, they felt like my heel slipped out too easily.  I thought the 10\\'s were perfect, but then started to pinch slightly the longer I walked around the store.  When I went back to the 10.5\\'s, they suddenly fit like a glove.I wore them to the movie theater this weekend, and smiled the whole time I sat there because these shoes feel like they\\'re hugging my feet.  Like \"sole\" mates finally united.  They have just the tiniest little arch support, not too much, just enough, and it\\'s appreciated.They just feel high quality.  I should never buy anything but Adidas again; I have a pair of Adidas hiking shoes that I\\'ve been wearing for over a decade.  They\\'ve seen better times, but are still super comfortable and still holding together (mostly).  When you find something that works, don\\'t fix it.  That\\'s why I feel like these could be my new \"forever\" shoe (if/when this pair wears out).  The look will clearly never go out of style, and (hopefully) the craftsmanship will stay first rate.',\n",

The arch support is obviously not as good as other shoes that focus on arch support but the arch support in these is better than pretty much any Adidas or Nike flat-soled shoe out there. If you actually play soccer like me, you'll love the pure feeling of the ball on your foot. The grip is ridiculously good, outdoors and indoors. If you feel that the grip sucks indoors, you need to wipe and clean the outsole. The first time you wear it, you'll notice how comfortable it is and it only gets better than that. It feels like it's already broken in but trust me.. when it really breaks in you won't be thinking about any other shoe. The first pair I bought was a special edition white with blue stripes and I can't find them anymore. This time I bought the black pair with white stripes. Get them and you'll be happy.\",\n",

If you wear air-soled running shoes, you probably won't even notice. Personally, I'm NOT A FAN.- The arch support has changed in the last 3 years (the last time I bought this pair). Be warned!ORIGINALS:adidas Originals Men's Samba Reflective Sneaker- Smaller tongue- Old-school arch support (meaning flatter/next to none). I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years, and identify with the barefoot-running crowd, so for me, flatter is better.- Harder to slip on/off, but once it's on, it fits like a glove!- Yes, they squeak like everyone says. Doesn't bother me, but then again I'm not a movie usher, burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other. For me, the clear winner is ORIGINALS.\",\n",

The sole provides a lot of grip (I don't play soccer in them but the floors at my work are often wet and I don't slip and fall). You can get the classic kind or the originals kind (only difference I can tell is the length of the tongue, I have no preference). The laces that came with mine are the perfect length, the shoes fit like a glove. Many say they run small, but I do believe they have wide feet, because the Sambas have a sort of average or almost narrow design. Either way they fit me perfect when I ordered my normal size. These shoes last a long time, I have owned a few pairs now. I wear them until they die which is everyday for about a year. They have many different colors to choose from, but they all look good. They can be casual shoes or dressed up just a tad (they're athletic shoes, not dress shoes) but they look good with jeans or shorts. Overall great shoes, Amazon has a great price for them. I highly recommend them!\",\n",

Kinda weird really that a shoe like this that's been around so long has these weird problems with design.Anyway, in terms of style they can't be beat. So you get a cool look but sacrifice a bit on the comfort front. I'm thinking about getting some new inserts to replace the stock ones. Maybe they'll be better after that.\",\n",

This shoe offers good arch support for those long days on my feet at work.My current pair has lasted me a decade (through High School and College). I have finally worn a hole in the heel side of the sole which lets water in if I step in a puddle, and the suede in some parts is worn smooth, but with a coat of carefully applied shoe polish, they don't look more than two or three years old.This is definitely a timeless shoe.

The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe. I don't know how this would happen and must be a problem with quality control with Adidas.

What else do you say about shoes?  Did I mention that these shoes feel great on the feet, as they would feel anywhere else?  Seriously, buy a pair if you\\'re into that whole wearing-shoes thing.  $40 or so for a great pair of shoes, very good deal.  I mean, you could do a lot worse; you could be spending any money at all on a pair of Crocs.  (Whatever America did to deserve those, we sincerely apologize.)  Anyway, wearing them with a pair of shorts is fine, but if you\\'re vain when it comes to your legs or you\\'re not quite ready to let your friends know that you too shave the fuzz from your legs, wear these Originals with a pair of trousers, khaki or gray, whatever you\\'re feeling.  The shoes are casually athletic, like white guys who say, \"Yeah, I play soccer\" but in fact have never played soccer for a recreational team and have little-to-none-at-all knowledge about the sport, but the idea sounds good.  What\\'s better than running around on green grass, sometimes getting to kick a ball, in short shorts and a jersey, giving yourself and others the impression that you\\'re athletic?  You\\'re fooling everyone, don\\'t worry.  And after you wipe your forehead and throw your short bangs back, covered in sweat, after you trot over to the sideline, breathing hard, grab a towel, wipe yourself off, sit down in the grass and not the bleachers (on purpose, of course; athletes don\\'t sit in seating apparatuses), take off those hopefully-filthy cleats and slip on these cool-as-hell vintage shoes.  I promise they will reinforce your image as an athlete.  Did I mention they feel like a foot-rub given by the most beautiful girl in the world?  Please, wear these shoes with a sense of honor: be yourself, and for God\\'s sakes, don\\'t pop your collar.',\n",

Inside I was upset to discover that the shoes look like they had been worn and possibly had been a return! The shoes and laces were dirty and had smudges! There was lint inside both shoes, obvious signs that they had been worn. I found hair inside of the shoes as well. I order from amazon weekly, and I was very upset to receive this as my order.  I requested an immediate return. Terrible!!!',\n",

However, it just doesn't fit correctly on the wide part of the foot between the arch and your toes.

I thought that maybe, like cleats, I just needed to &#34;break them in.&#34; The first day it hurt a lot, but I put up with it. The second day it hurt a little bit less, so I thought maybe it was getting better. The third day it hurt more than the first two days...so I said forget it...I have to return them. Also, loosening them doesn't help either.It was a tough decision because they used to be amazing shoes: unmatched traction, perfect style. However, it's not worth messing up your feet.

I had to oil the leather and the felt and leave them rubber-banded for the first few weeks of wear to get it to fold over. My only reservation is that the arch support could be placed a little farther back in the shoe, to really 'cup' the heel. But overall I am super impressed by the rest of the support.

These shoes are really well made, the leather is very high quality plus they are cool, classic and functional. If you are getting these for soccer I would say get the long tongue (more control over the ball), if you just want these for the look the short tongue is fine. I actually have the Samba K's, kangaroo leather version at the moment and I was really upset to see that they have discontinued them. I have read that the K's are incredibly durable and the leather just molds to your foot in a unique way. I think they look as good now as they did 5 years ago. These shoes do run narrow, so I usually get a half size larger and that works for me since I have wider feet. Overall you cannot go wrong with these. They are worth any price IMO.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"I first bought these shoes for their style and for indoor soccer a few years ago. They worked wonders, they're overall comfy, functional, and have great style. Recently though, I essentially tore open the bottom of my K-Swiss Ariakes and so to do parkour I switched to these shoes. Surprisingly, they were also great for parkour. It is not something many would assume, the lack of cushioning, hard sole etc. etc. But contrary to those facts, the hard sole provided enough grip to be functional, not as much as the Ariakes, but acceptable amounts. The thin sole also actually helped my form, having a thinner sole allows for better feel and results in a more refined technique. The cushioning problem also actually helps you, it points out the flaws in your running and landing and after a while you don't feel the shock of the hits. Also, these are built tough. The leather shows signs of wear and tear without yielding, the sole is hard and will take a lot of effort to wear down, I only recently broke these after almost 2 and a half years of wear, and that's when I was doing hard wall runs. And an added bonus, the leather keeps moisture out so your feet don't get all wet when running after it rains. The pros and cons of these shoes have been iterated many times already in these reviews, so looking at them from a different perspective, as a traceur, these shoes perform wonderfully. They are not real parkour shoes (if those actually can be a category) but they are amazing trainers and will not dissapoint.\",\n",

There are the Adidas Originals sambas, and a few other varieties, but their quality and comfort all pale in comparison to the classic. Notable differences are the strength of the heals (Metal on the Classic, cardboard/plastic on the Originals), the rubber compound in the sole (the originals version is a harder, less grippy, more plastic compound, and finally the quality of the leather and stitching. I had a pair of the originals in green and the leather had completely separated from the sole in less than a year. On the contrary, my first pair of Sambas, which are classics, have lasted nearly four years under harsh conditions such as white water rafting trips and to this day I wear them at my job as a cook.',\n",

In my shallowness, I bought them on looks alone for around-the-house/ casual-Friday's.They are a bit narrow, which is great for me. But they do lack a bit in arch/ball of the foot support. You'd think that if they're making these shoes for narrow-footed people, they would have better arch support because most people with narrow feet tend to have higher arches, right? If you have wide feet, you might want to avoid these.As for the extra-long tongue, I have to say that I kind of like it. It makes the shoes unique. But I think if you wore low-socks, the tongue might chafe you and look funny. Also, folding the tongue down looks kind of dumb as you can see part of the sizing tag.I found the sizing (10.5) to be pretty much right on, maybe a smidge bigger than my other Adidas. Overall though, for the price (I found mine on sale for $30!), I thought they were are a great deal! I really like these Samba Classics. They look fantastic and fit good for a casual shoe. I just wish they had a bit more support (like the Samba Millenium's do), then they'd be perfect.\",\n",

I have wide feet, but I typically don't have problems fitting into normal shoes.  For some reason these are narrower than your typical shoe so if you have wide feet you probably want to avoid these.  However, that's not my main complaint.  While these shoes are stylish and comfortable to walk around in, they're horrible soccer shoes.  I've played on two separate indoor fields and anytime I make a hard cut I slip.  The other problem is that after a game my feet are sore due to the lack of arch support.  I run on a regular basis and I also play basketball once a week on a hard court and I've never had issues with sore feet.\",\n",

They are these things that you put on your feet to protect them! Crazy right? That\\'s what I thought, witchcraft this must be. But no! There is no magic(or so I have yet to spot, however witches are crafty so I will update as soon as I find out more). This is an amazing product, all you do is put it on your feet (make sure the correct foot or else it can be uncomfortable) and your feet are protected from the following: Rocks, gum, hypodermic needles, vomit, spit, dog poo, water, broken glass, dry pokey grass, mud, pesky bums sleeping on the ground, and so much more! However they still don\\'t protect you from the following: Bullets, mines, stab wounds, and std\\'s, and a few other things so just be careful.I know what you must be thinking, \"You put these on your feet? But that\\'s what my feet are for! They already do the job, why bog them down\"? That\\'s what I thought, but you know the saying, \"Once you wear shoes, you won\\'t even think about cereal again\".

They absorb no impact when you run and even though I tied them as tight as I could, blisters will still forming.The one positive thing I'll say about them is they get much more traction then my regular sneakers on an indoor basketball floor so I can change direction better, which is part of the reason I get blisters because I cut/change direction very fast.  (I get them with regular shoes, but I was hoping these would stop that)I suppose if you're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers.

My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look.\",\n",

I bought them @ second semester of junior year in High school. Now I'm 2nd year in college using it to play indoor soccer.Pros:1) Comfortable  -> I wear it for casual occasions (before it got dirty from activities)2) tough and well made -> This shoe has the longest lifespan compared all shoes I've worn.3) Not too flashy and very low profile, but it's still classy4) Recommended for indoor courts -> Although it's meant for soccer, I also use it for badminton, tennis, and basketball , because I'm cheap like that. =PCons(only towards the end of my third year):1) tip of the laces started ripping2) back of the shoes started ripping3) I didn't like the tongue design but it's a minor thing.It served me well till the end. Now, I just bought a white one from amazon cuz it's on sale. >.&lt;I'd recommend it for anyone who plays court sports. I also use insoles for extra comfort and this also prevents feet injury.\",\n",

Despite the lack of cushioning in the Classics, I can wear them for hours on hard courts and turf without any problem. I also own Samba Vulcs, which are equally comfortable to me.I was intrigued by these Samba Milleniums, which I have never seen in a retail store. When I received them, I was impressed by how good they look. The lines are not as clean as the Samba Classics, but so much better than most modern trainers which look like spaceships on your feet. When I put them on, I was also impressed how comfortable they felt. The toe box is larger than the Classics. I usually have the wear the Classics for a week for the toe box to stretch out enough to be comfortable, but I didn't have that issue with the Milleniums. There is also just the right amount of padding in the heel - enough to add comfort, but not so much that you can't feel the ball.The reason I'm deducting 1 star from perfect is that right now, the shoe rubs against my left lateral malleolus, which doesn't happen with the Classics. I'm hoping that with some break-in, this problem will go away.\",\n",

These are the best indoor shoes I've ever owned.I'm writing a review because I read some of the other reviews that stated they were too small and or took a long time to break in.  I'm a firm believer that soccer shoes should fit like a second skin.  I've only had one pair of soccer shoes ever (they were outdoor) that broke in quickly--they were very soft leather.  The drawback to soft leather shoes is that they are typically less durable, though that pair actually lasted me a few seasons.Shoes with stiffer leather take longer to break in, plain and simple.  Stiff leather shoes are painful to break in if you want them to stretch to your fit.  I usually endure a few hours of pain wearing new soccer shoes around my house (not all at once of course) before wearing them during play.I'm now buying my second pair of Samba Millenium's.  I bought the first pair at a shoe store after having tried them on there.  I recall the first pair taking a couple of hours of wear around the house and still being uncomfortable during play.  Then after a few sessions of play they were comfortable.  My first pair lasted me 4 or 5 winters of play, 1 to 2 x per week. I'm looking forward to another 4 or 5 winters with my next pair.Best indoor shoes I've ever had.  Durability second to none.  Comfort, after a lengthy breaking in period, second to none.So if you can hack breaking them in, these are great shoes.  If you want shoes that break in quickly, head to the soccer shop and try on some pairs with softer leather.\",\n",

The quality and foot support of this sneaker is undeniable and the product itself has maintained it's status as a 'goto' sneaker for soccer players. You see these shoes everywhere (often times the black version). When you combine the build of the shoe with a very reasonable price tag it is not surprising that Sambas are still as popular as they ever were.If you are used to a running shoe the wear might feel a little different as I feel like the Sambas give you a 'flatter' wear in the sole. They aren't as springy as a running shoe. This is just a matter of preference. They still offer great arch and foot support.I would definitely recommend Sambas to anyone looking for a casual everyday sneaker or someone who plays indoor soccer.\",\n",

This style of Sambas are not my favorite (favorites being the Top Salas from around 2000), but they are still very nice and *comfortable.*Lets talk about comfort though.  I have had this issue only with one other style of Sambas (the Classic) and that is regarding the time it takes to break these in so I can actually bare walking.  Even though these shoes fit great now and are probably my most comfortable pair and shoe of choice most days, it took about a month of going through some painful heels and a few blisters to get to this point.I know there are ways to \"work\" your shoes out and break them in, but no matter what I did they were still giving me issues for a long time. I have only bought a few pairs of shoes that needed special treatment to break them in, but these were by far some of the most difficult to work out.Overall, I love these shoes and if you can get through the painful breaking-in period the shoes come out fitting your feet just wonderfully and are great, comfortable shoes for everyday casual wear.',\n",

So after owning them I wanted to have the Sambas Milleniums to add to my collection.Note that they do run a bit narrow and for me a size smaller than my natural fit. I am a 10 and purchased a 10.5, which fit nice. Also, when I first put on my Sambas Millenium, I got bad blisters on the back of both my heels. Nevertheless, after reading some reviews here suggesting that you need to break them in to prevent this from occurring in the future (which for me was only after wearing them more than 3 times for me), this did not occur again and now are very, very comfortable. So don't let the initial break-in period cause you to return them right away. Like all good shoes, they need time to fit to your foot.Anyway, I highly recommend these shoes.\",\n",

As other reviewers have mentioned, I also believe that the Milleniums are a \"updated version\" of the other Samba models. They have good cushioning & support. I only wear them for casual wear. They fit true to length. As with most Adidas, and other soccer type shoes, they are pretty narrow. I have narrow feet anyways, but with these, I just keep the shoestrings a little looser than other shoes I wear & they feel great. Amazon had the best price of these shoes ($11 cheaper than competitors). Overall, I\\'m happy with the Milleniums, but would recommend for someone with wide feet.',\n",

Although I love soccer and need good shoes to play sala, I actually got these shoes because they had had a pair before and they were so form fitting and true to size that I just couldn't go to another shoe.I ended up getting the black with white stripes so that i could use them as shoes for everyday use and not just for playing soccer.  this was a good decision because i have seen friends with the white and they now look dirty and almost old because of mud or scuff marks.  I do like the white better if you are using them solely for playing soccer, but i am like the black better overall.Anyone who has ever used indoor soccer shoes will know that they are all very comfortable, but some are better than others.  i have had a few pairs from other brand names and I have to admit the sambas that I have now are by far the most comfortable. The shoes might seem a bit tight at first but after a few weeks of use they form to your feet and stretch a bit.  The size runs pretty true so you don't have to worry about getting the wrong size and have to return them.The shoes are very durable and I wear them everywhere, they go well with short, jeans, long socks, short socks and almost anything else. The construction is great and they are very reliable.I don't know if I have any complaints about these shoes and I have loved them since I have bought them.  Although if you live in a place where it snows or gets icy, they are not the best for grip in the snow so thats probably the only thing negative to these shoes.I highly recommend these shoes to anyone.\",\n",

Beware that buying this shoe may make you an adidas fan for a long time.By the way, I have very wide feet and I can't wear this shoe, even though I'd like to.

I am very happy with my purchase as the flip-flops are very comfortable. The strap has a Velcro strip so the footwear can be adjusted to ensure a snug fit; the footwear appears extremely well made; and the little rubber nubs feel great against the soles of my feet. I have very sensitive feet so sometimes it can take a few minutes for my feet to adjust to the massage when I first put these on, but once my feet get used to the feeling within a minute or two the massaging effect feels absolutely wonderful. I'd definitely recommend the Adidas Santiossage to others.\",\n",

I generally wear these as slippers in the house (I don't like to run around barefoot) - usually with socks. I liked that these were open toed, as opposed to the many types that go between your toes. The velcro makes adjusting them to your foot easy, and I've never reset it sinceA couple of comments -When I first got them, they were somewhat uncomfortable while the nubs were still stiff. I wasn't sure I would be able to continue using them. This got better after a few weeks. I was using them on my walking treadmill one day (with socks), and they actually started to irritate my feet. I generally don't wear these for long distances, but occasionally I will step up to my desk for something short, and 45 minutes later, I'm still there. I'm sure you know what I mean. Recently, I did the same thing, and didn't have any problems.Second, the nubs do break off - not all at once, mind you, but I have several broken on each foot. This doesn't interfere with their comfort or usability in any way.Third - these are fully plastic (or some polyvinyl water resistant product) so they can be rinsed off or can get wet in the shower. The biggest problem I've had with them is my cat got upset with me one day and threw up on one. I didn't realize it until I'd stepped in it, and squeezed it down between the nubs. Let me tell you, it took a while to get it rinsed out -- even with the kitchen scrub brush.I would certainly buy these again - they've proven durable enough to stand up to regular use, and they can get wet (ie: if I take a step outside to get the mail or take out the recycling) without any damage. They can probably be used as shower shoes at the gym, though I haven't used them for this purpose.\",\n",

Here's the strange part... you'd think the nubs on the sandal would raise the foot to get more air circulation but I'm not so sure about that. He's only been wearing them for a few weeks but the foot odor trapped in the sandals is intolerable. He's had lower quality slides without the nubs that didn't smell. Maybe the material and structure of these slides hold moisture better. Okay, I wrote all of that a couple of months ago and now I'm adding this: The nubs are all falling off the shoes! It's VERY annoying because I'm finding them all over the house and unfortunately, so is my 10 month old son who spends much of his time crawling on the floor.

Now they produce them in Vietnam, the design is slightly different, but the big change is the material. It's harder, less flexible, and I imagine more durable. So it will take longer to break in and I'm not sure if it will ever be as comfortable as the older ones. But on the plus side it should last longer. The curve is less though and it's not as comfortable to walk in as my old ones. That might change in time, but it's also a bit higher, so I guess it will never be like the old ones exactly.
